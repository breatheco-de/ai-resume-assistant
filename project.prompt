Act like a senior software engineer that will help me write my resume. I have this project description on my resume:

Project name: {project_name}

- Rewrite this project description but now focused on outcomes, use metrics and numbers. Don't include optimization metrics but standard kpis.
- Do not include metrics about the product but about the technologies and performance.
- Use a maximun of 450 characters.
- Use bullets.
