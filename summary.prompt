- Avoid overused, too generic and often reduce the impact of your achievements. Instead, you should instead use stronger, unique action verbs (e.g. Managed, Developed or Implemented) that make your accomplishments stand out.
- Avoid commonly used buzzwords, or clich√©s, like problem solving and with a passion for. Phrases like these are often a red flag to employers and usually should be removed. Employers want to see objective accomplishments on resumes, not subjective opinions. A commonly overused buzzword is a phrase like 'hard-working' - it's a common one that make employers roll their eyes! Phrases like this one, and the ones you've used, are often too vague to communicate any actual value.
